## Overview
The Redux Todo App is a web application built with React and Redux for state management. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, and it helps manage the application's state in a consistent way. This app allows users to add and remove todo items, providing a seamless user experience with the help of Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features
- Add new todos with a text input.
- Remove todos by clicking on the 'X' button next to each todo item.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS for easy viewing on different devices.
